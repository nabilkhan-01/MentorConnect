Assignment Prompt: Mentor-Mentee Website for College 
Design and develop a responsive and user-friendly website for managing the college’s 
Mentor-Mentee system. The platform should support three user roles: Admin, Mentor, and 
Mentee, each with specific permissions and functionality. 
User Roles and Permissions 
Admin 
• Full access to the system. 
• Can upload student data via Excel sheet, which automatically assigns students to 
mentors. 
• Can manually add or delete students. 
• If a mentor leaves, the system automatically reassigns their mentees to other 
mentors, ensuring equal distribution based on the student's semester. 
• Can view at-risk students (e.g., attendance <85%). 
• Can delete student data from the system if the student leaves the college, 
removing their data from the mentor’s records. 
• Can view error logs for tracking failed actions like failed uploads or missing data. 
Mentor 
• Can view and manage only their assigned mentees. 
• Can add new students to their mentee group by filling out a form. 
• Can upload an Excel sheet to add multiple students to their mentee group. 
• Can delete students from their mentee group if needed. 
• Can update mentee details such as: 
o Name, USN, Email, Mobile Number, Parent's Mobile Number 
o Semester, Section 
o CIE marks,assignment marks,total marks and subject-wise attendance 
• Can view a list of at-risk students (e.g., attendance <85%). 
Mentee (Student) 
• Can log in and view only their own personal and academic data. 
Core Functional Features 
•  Excel Upload: 
o Admin can upload a bulk student list for assignment. 
o Mentors can upload an Excel sheet to add students to their own mentee 
group. 
•  Manual Student Entry: 
o Admin and mentors can manually add new students. 
o Admin and mentors can delete students from the system. 
•  Automatic Student Reassignment: 
o If a mentor leaves, the system automatically reassigns their mentees to 
other mentors. 
o Reassignment ensures equal or approximately equal distribution of 
students. 
•  At-Risk Student List: 
o Identifies students with attendance below 85%. 
o Allows mentors to track and intervene with at-risk students. 
•  Responsive Web Design: 
o Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 
•  Structured Database: 
o Data is securely stored and organized using a well-structured database 
schema. 
Enhanced Features for Efficiency 
•  Analytics Dashboard: 
o Visual reports on mentee performance (attendance, CIE scores, etc.). 
o Track at-risk students for timely intervention. 
•  Search & Filter Tools: 
o Search and filter students by various parameters (name, USN, semester, 
attendance, etc.). 
•  Notifications: 
o Alerts for mentors about at-risk students, low attendance, and updates 
from admin. 
•  Export Data: 
o Ability to export student records (e.g., to Excel or PDF) for reporting or 
backup. 
• Activity Logs: 
o Track all changes (e.g., students added, deleted, updated). 
•  Mentor Feedback: 
o Mentors can log private notes on mentee progress, interventions, and 
achievements. 
•  Security: 
o Two-factor authentication for Admin. 
o Role-based access ensures secure data management. 
o Encryption of sensitive data (e.g., contact details). 
Additional Enhancements 
1. Data Validation & Error Handling 
• Form Validation: 
o Ensure that email, mobile number, CIE marks, attendance, and date fields 
follow correct formats. 
o Regex validation for email, mobile number, and attendance. 
o Numeric checks for marks and attendance to ensure they are within the 
valid range (e.g., 0–100). 
• Clear Error Messages: 
o Provide real-time feedback to users with detailed, easy-to-understand error 
messages when data is incorrect or missing. 
• Error Logs for Admin: 
o Track failed actions like failed uploads or invalid data. 
o Provide an Admin dashboard to view and address any errors in the system. 
2. Role-Based Permissions for Deleting Students 
• Delete Confirmation: 
o Before deletion, both Mentors and Admins will receive a confirmation 
prompt to prevent accidental deletions: 
▪ "Are you sure you want to delete this student? This action cannot be 
undone." 
• Admin vs Mentor Deletion Permissions: 
o Admins can delete any student. 
o Mentors can only delete students within their assigned mentee group. 
3. Backup & Data Recovery 
Since your college has its own server, backups will be stored locally: 
• Automated Backups: 
o Daily/weekly backups of the database to prevent data loss. Use cron jobs 
(on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to schedule backups. 
o Backup files will be stored securely on the server in dedicated directories 
(e.g., /backups/2025-05-01/). 
• Backup File Format: 
o Use SQL Dump for database backups and compress the backups (e.g., 
.tar.gz or .zip) to save space. 
• Data Restoration: 
o Admins can restore data from the backup files in case of system failure 
using MySQL 
• Backup Monitoring: 
o Email notifications or system logs should inform the Admin if any backup 
fails. 
4. Scalability 
• Horizontal Scalability: 
o The website should be scalable to handle increasing numbers of students, 
mentors, and data without performance degradation. Use database 
partitioning and load balancing to distribute traffic and prevent 
performance bottlenecks. 
• Cloud Hosting: 
o Though your college has its own server, cloud-based hosting services (e.g., 
AWS, Google Cloud) can be used in the future to ensure scalability. 
• Database Optimization: 
o Use indexes and caching to speed up queries and ensure optimal 
performance even as data volume grows. 
• Performance Monitoring: 
o Implement tools to monitor system performance, identifying bottlenecks 
and improving overall efficiency. 
Security 
• Role-Based Access Control: 
o Secure the system with role-based access to ensure that users can only 
perform actions appropriate to their role. 
• Data Encryption: 
o Ensure sensitive data (like student personal information) is encrypted to 
protect privacy. 
• Two-Factor Authentication: 
o Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for Admin users to enhance security.
